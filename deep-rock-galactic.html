                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Danish studio Ghost
                    Ship Games and published by Coffee Stain Publishing. Deep Rock Galactic was fully released on May
                    13, 2020 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One after its early access[1] release in February 28, 2018.
                    The game was later released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in January 2022,[2] and for Xbox
                    Series X/S in September 2022.[3]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic is set on the alien planet of Hoxxes IV, whose caves are rich in minerals but
                    filled with hostile wildlife and hazardous environments. The player controls a dwarf miner employed
                    by Deep Rock Galactic, an intergalactic mining corporation that sends employees into the caves of
                    Hoxxes IV to extract resources. Players can team up with up to three other dwarves on missions into
                    the planet, where they must navigate procedurally generated caves and complete objectives while
                    fighting alien swarms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its class-based gameplay and
                    atmosphere. The game has sold over eight million units as of January 2024 and has been part of the
                    Xbox Game Pass subscription service since November 2020. It was also available to PlayStation Plus
                    subscribers during the month of its release.[4]

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic is a cooperative first-person shooter. Gameplay primarily centers around missions
                    that take place in fully destructible, procedurally generated cave systems; each has varying terrain
                    generation, objectives, hazards, and enemies depending on the selected biome and mission type.[5]
                    Upon landing in a cave via an orbital drop pod, players must complete a mission objective, such as
                    mining resources or repairing abandoned equipment. While doing so, they must fight hostile aliens,
                    manage a limited supply of ammunition, and navigate the cave. Once the objective is completed,
                    players can start an extraction sequence, where players must backtrack through the cave to an escape
                    pod in order to safely exit along with all collected resources.[6] Optional secondary objectives[7]
                    (such as collecting a number of specific objects or mining enough of a unique mineral) are also
                    available, offering players additional credits and experience.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Players can play missions solo or with up to three other players. Before starting each mission,
                    players choose one of four playable classes: Scout, Engineer, Gunner, and Driller. Each class has a
                    unique loadout of weapons and tools, giving them varied capabilities in combat and navigation.[7] By
                    working together to take advantage of how these different capabilities interact, teams can more
                    efficiently navigate a cave, complete objectives, and fight enemies.[8][9] As an example, the
                    Engineer class can place platforms on walls, while the Scout class has a personal grappling hook. In
                    order to mine a difficult-to-reach mineral deposit high up on a wall, an Engineer could place a
                    platform beneath the deposit and a Scout could then grapple on top of the platform to safely mine
                    the deposit.[7] When playing solo, players can choose to be accompanied by a robot, which assists
                    with objectives and combat.[8]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game features various progression systems, such as new weapons, equipment upgrades, and
                    cosmetics, that can be purchased using credits and crafting minerals obtained from missions.[6] By
                    completing challenges, players can also acquire perks; these give dwarves additional abilities, such
                    as increased running speed.[8][10] Since 2021, there have been seasonal events in which players can
                    unlock items via a free battle pass-like system.[11] Players have the option to switch active
                    seasons at any moment outside of a mission, including having no active season.[12] All of the unique
                    rewards each season contains can be obtained by playing through its corresponding season.

                <h2>Game Modes</h2>
                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic has a total of 9 game modes, also referred to in game as missions:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Mining Expedition:</dt>
                    <dd>The first mission type unlocked, players are tasked with mining a certain quantity of the
                        mineral Morkite and extracting.</dd>
                    <dt>Egg Hunt:</dt>
                    <dd>Pockets of organic alien matter spawn around the cave, housing eggs that players must collect
                        and deposit. Extracting an egg can trigger a wave of enemies.</dd>
                    <dt>On-site Refining:</dt>
                    <dd>Wells of liquid Morkite must be connected with pipelines to a central refinery and pumped until
                        the refinery is full, while players repair the pipelines during timed failures.</dd>
                    <dt>Salvage Operation:</dt>
                    <dd>Set in a previously explored cave, players must repair storage robots and an abandoned drop pod
                        left behind from a previous mining crew in order to extract.</dd>
                    <dt>Point Extraction:</dt>
                    <dd>A central platform is dropped into the cave the players spawn in (replacing the usual robotic
                        pack mule), where they must collect, carry, and deposit large bright blue gems embedded in the
                        cave walls.</dd>
                    <dt>Deep Scan:</dt>
                    <dd>Added in the Season 5 update, players must locate and mine precious Morkite Seeds that are found
                        in geodes deep underground. To pinpoint their location, the player must locate Resonance
                        Crystals and construct scanners atop them. Next is an escort stage where the players must
                        protect the Drillevator, a vertical drill, from the hostile lifeforms of Hoxxes IV as it drills
                        its way into the geode. Once the geode is dry of resources, the players will ascend to the
                        caverns with the use of specialized jet boots.</dd>
                    <dt>Escort Duty:</dt>
                    <dd>An Ommoran Heartstone lies at the end of a cave system, where a large autonomous drill robot
                        must be protected from enemies en route to the Heartstone. This is followed by a survival
                        sequence where players must protect the drill once more as it extracts the core of the
                        Heartstone, which they must deposit to extract.</dd>
                    <dt>Elimination:</dt>
                    <dd>Players must seek and eliminate Glyphid Dreadnoughts, which are boss variants of the common
                        Glyphid enemy.</dd>
                    <dt>Industrial Sabotage:</dt>
                    <dd>added in the Season 1 update, this mission sees players disable the force field of a large
                        security robot known as the Caretaker by hacking its power generators. This prompts a
                        multi-stage fight with the Caretaker; upon its destruction, the data rack it was protecting
                        (belonging to a corporate rival) becomes available to deposit.[13]</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Each mission type can be played on six different difficulties, called hazard levels. Each level
                    increases enemy health, damage, and spawn volume and frequency. Missions can also have one of three
                    mission lengths and cave complexity modifiers, which gives players a longer objective and makes the
                    cave bigger and more complex respectively. There are also randomly assigned modifiers that a mission
                    can have up to two of. These modifiers are broken into two categories, being Anomalies and Warnings,
                    with Anomalies typically having good or neutral effects, and Warnings having negative effects but
                    offering more experience to compensate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to standard missions, there are two special mission types, referred to as Deep Dives and
                    Elite Deep Dives. In these, a randomly generated sequence of three missions in an ascending
                    difficulty is created, with the biome, mission type, modifiers, and layouts being almost entirely
                    random. All three missions must be completed consecutively, although resources are carried over
                    between each of the three missions. In addition to credit and experience rewards, players receive
                    special items called Matrix Cores, which are used to unlock weapon modifications and cosmetic items.
                    However, these can only be collected once per mission per week, resulting in a total of six Cores if
                    both the Deep Dive and the Elite Deep Dive are completed.

                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic is the first game developed by Ghost Ship Games. The team has stated that they
                    took inspiration from both Minecraft and Left 4 Dead,[14] and felt that a problem with Left 4 Dead
                    was that it was unbalanced for new players who wanted to play with veterans, and wanted to design a
                    game where all teammates would be on even footing regardless of experience.[15]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep Rock Galactic entered early access on February 28, 2018, where it stayed for two years prior to
                    its full release in 2020.[9][16][17][18] Ghost Ship Games used the early access model to get
                    community feedback in order to determine which features to prioritize. The low-poly art style was
                    chosen for its efficiency in adding content.[19] The most difficult part of development was creating
                    the procedural world generator. Deep Rock Galactic used Unreal Engine for development and was made
                    with the engine's Blueprint scripting for quick iteration.[20]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The full version of the game was released on May 13, 2020.[21] Post-launch, the game continues to be
                    developed, with intermittent updates adding new biomes, equipment, and accessories. Since November
                    4, 2021, Ghost Ship Games has begun releasing content in themed season updates. These center around
                    new enemy types and add new equipment, missions, and cosmetics.[11][22]

                <h2>Reception</h2>
                <p>
                    The Early Access version of Deep Rock Galactic was received positively by critics, who praised the
                    game's atmosphere and challenging levels. Multiple reviewers compared parts of the experience to
                    Left 4 Dead.[9][5] Following Early Access, the full version of Deep Rock Galactic received
                    "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator Metacritic.[29][30]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nic Reuben of Rock, Paper, Shotgun liked how the game's classes meshed together, saying that "each
                    class is both viable and enjoyable".[31] Matt Miller of Game Informer appreciated how the unique
                    secondary objectives gave the game a risk/reward dynamic.[32] Phil Iwaniuk, writing for PC Gamer,
                    enjoyed the tension that the exfiltration phase brought to each mission, and the persistent upgrades
                    that let the player customize their dwarf.[33] Leana Hafer of IGN praised the distinct abilities of
                    each of the dwarves and the low-poly visual style, but criticized the game for its connection
                    issues, saying "About one in every five missions, I’d run into connection issues that could cause
                    other players to lag severely and disconnect."[8]

                <p>
                    A Kickstarter for Deep Rock Galactic: The Board Game was successfully funded in early 2022.[45]
                </p>
                <p>
                    A spin-off video game, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, was announced in March 2023. In contrast to the
                    original, the title is a Vampire Survivors-inspired top-down shooter developed by Funday Games. It
                    was released in early access during 2023.[46]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another spin-off, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, was announced in October 2023. Much like the
