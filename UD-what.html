                <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                <p>Universal design in web design refers to the practice of creating websites and digital interfaces that are accessible, usable, and inclusive for the widest possible audience. It involves designing with consideration for people of all abilities, ages, and circumstances, ensuring that everyone can interact with the content effectively. This includes implementing features like keyboard navigation, responsive layouts that adapt to different devices, and text alternatives for images and multimedia. Universal design emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and consistency, making it easier for users to understand and navigate websites. It also incorporates standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to meet the needs of individuals who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers or voice input tools. Ultimately, universal design is about breaking down barriers and creating digital spaces where everyone can participate fully.</p>
                <p>Proper semantic markup is a cornerstone of universal web design because it provides meaningful structure to web content, making it more accessible to both users and machines. Semantic tags, like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, clearly define the purpose of different parts of a webpage, improving navigation and understanding for users, especially those using assistive technologies. Screen readers rely on these tags to convey the hierarchy and relationships of content, allowing users with visual impairments to navigate efficiently. </p>
                <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of internationally recognized standards for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), WCAG outlines principles and specific criteria to ensure that websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust (often referred to as the POUR principles). These guidelines address various accessibility needs, such as providing text alternatives for images, ensuring keyboard navigability, and maintaining sufficient color contrast. WCAG is organized into levels of compliance—A (basic), AA (recommended), and AAA (enhanced)—to help developers and organizations prioritize and meet accessibility goals. By following WCAG, web creators can build more inclusive digital experiences that work well for all users.</p>
