    <h3>About Me</h3>
    Hi, my name is Tyler and I am a senior studying computer science, but what I really like doing is all forms of electronics. 
    I program in a variety of languages but my favorites are the ones that I can use for embedded systems.
    I play Magic: The Gathering in my spare time and use it has a an excuse to practive programming by catalogging them.
